# Challenges

You wanna help?  You're so cool ‚ù§ Here's a list of things that need
doing, similar to how an issue tracker would outline them.  We'll try
to keep this list up-to-date, and also always feel free to e-mail the
"community" mailing list for feedback or ask on IRC!


## UDP driver testing 

There's netmod-udp in the qaul.net tree, and while it's mostly (?)
done, it could use some testing.  Best to just ping spacekookie or pbb
on IRC or the mailing list for this, as it's a bit more vague.
