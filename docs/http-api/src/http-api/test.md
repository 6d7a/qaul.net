# Test The HTTP API

There are shell scripts over which you can test all the functions 
of the HTTP API.

The bash test scripts are located in the folder [tests/http-api](https://git.open-communication.net/qaul/qaul.net/-/tree/master/tests%2Fhttp-api) of the qaul.net repository.

How to execute and use the test scripts is documented in the [README.md](https://git.open-communication.net/qaul/qaul.net/-/blob/master/tests/http-api/README.md) file in the test script folder.
