# qaul.net android support

This library provides android specific bindings for the qaul.net
ecosystem (`libqaul`, `ratman`, `ratman-configure`, `netmod-wd`, and
`netmod-tcp`)

You don't need to build this library by yourself, this is handled by
the android build harness.  If you want to develop on this crate (for
testing or other reasons), a normal Rust development setup will be
enough.
